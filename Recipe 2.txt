Ingredients 

    ▢ 1 10-12 lb Whole Packer Cut Brisket untrimmed
    ▢ ¼ cup of Sea Salt
    ▢ ¼ cup of Black Pepper
    ▢ 1 tbsp of Chipotle Powder optional
    ▢ 2 tbsp of Olive Oil

Instructions 

    Trim the brisket to your desire, then lather with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper (plus chipotle powder if you like). Set in your fridge to chill for 2 hours or ideally overnight.
    Preheat your smoker to 250F using Cowboy Charcoal and a few chunks of Cowboy Hickory Wood.
    Place your seasoned brisket fat side down on the smoker and cook until the outside is a mahogany color and the internal temperature is 165 F (about 4-6 hours). Add Cowboy Charcoal as needed to maintain temperature.
    Pull the brisket off the skillet and wrap in either peach butcher paper or tin foil. Place brisket pack on to the smoker with fat side up and continue cooking until it reaches 190 F internal (about 2-3 hours).
    Once it hits 190 F internal, flip the brisket back to fat side down and finish cooking until a fork slides into it like butter (around 203-205 F internal and about 2-3 more hours).
    When the brisket is done, pull off and let rest for one hour at room temperature. You can also wrap it in a towel and place it into a cooler for up to 5 or 6 hours to keep it warm and rest.
    Slice brisket against the grain and enjoy!
