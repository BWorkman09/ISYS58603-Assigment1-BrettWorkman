Ingredients 

    ¼ recipe of birria consomé
    20 corn tortillas
    2 cups shredded Oaxaca cheese
    1 peeled and small diced yellow onions
    ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
    juice of 2 lemons

Instructions

    Prepare the birria consomé but do not add the chopped meat back to the strained liquid in the pot.
    Making 1 taco at a time, lightly dip two corn tortillas into the top part of the consomé liquid and place on top of each other in a cast-iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat.
    Immediately, evenly sprinkle some of the cheese on top of the corn tortilla, followed by evenly adding some of the chopped meat to the one-half side of the taco on top of the cheese.
    At this point, you can also add diced onions and cilantro, but that part is optional.
    Cook for a minute or two and then fold the taco over to help form it. Cook for about one more minute.
    Repeat the process until all of the meat has been used.
    Serve each taco with a small bowl of the consomé liquid that has been garnished with lemon juice, diced onions, and cilantro.

Notes
Make-Ahead: The tacos are meant to be eaten right away, but you can make them up to 30 minutes ahead of time and keep them warm covered in foil at the lowest temperature in the oven.
How to Store: It is best to store the beef separately from the corn tortilla shells. Store the beef covered for up to 6 days in its liquid or consomé. This will freeze very well covered for up to 6 months in its liquid, or consomé. Thaw in the refrigerator for 1 day before reheating.
How to Reheat: Place the desired amount of beef in its liquid, or consomé, in a medium-size pot and heat over low heat until hot. You can also heat in the microwave until hot.
There should be enough fat on the top of the consomé when you dip the tortilla in there to brown it while cooking in the pan. If not, add a little oil or butter to the pan first.
You may need to use two corn tortilla shells so they don’t rip from the liquid.
